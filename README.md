# Airbnb Price Prediction with Machine Learning

This was a group project for the University of Auckland's Business Analytics 302 (Big Data and Machine Learning) course.
Team Members: Danny Weng, Lance Nilio, Nancy Wu, Daniel Chua, Winson Liang

This project analyses AirBnB listings across various European cities using machine learning techniques to predict rental prices. The aim is to assist hosts and property owners to have a better statistical understanding of what factors influence pricing and how to optimise listings for maximum value.
We used a dataset containing 41714 AirBnB listings with 16 features attributes, including room type, location, etc. After data cleaning and feature engineering, we trained a linear regression model to predict listing prices.

A detailed overview on the project can be found in the file "BUSAN_302_Project_Report".
